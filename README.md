# Challenges We Ran Into 🔍🚧
    .Challenge : Our team faced difficulties in working with webRTC and socket.io , as these technologies were completely new to us and we have to read numerous documentations and go through many tutorials to                     implement it in our project
     Solution : Our problem solving ability helped us to solve bugs and resolves issues we developed till now , and to implement and made a fully functional video calling app
     
    .Challenge: our team faced difficulties in integrating ml model to webRTC and socket io
     Solution: Our dedicated team invested significant effort in refining the gesture recognition algorithms. Rigorous testing, meticulous data collection, and precision fine-tuning led us to achieve    
                exceptional accuracy. Collaborating with gesture recognition experts further enriched our solution.
